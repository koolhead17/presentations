Expected Audience *

Anyone and everyone who witnessed the old Linux User Group meetup, install fest and events.

Description of Talk/Workshop *

Linux is more than 20 years old now and so is the community around it. 
Linux user group was the key during those days and monthly meetup, install fest and workshop were key part of it. Irc, mailinglist were considered to be the place for asking help and user used to abide strictly with " how to ask smart question" guidelines. 
As time changed we see number of these groups becoming dormant/non-active, number of FOSS events organized under banner of these groups has fallen sharply.

My presentation will focus basically on directions:-
1. What resulted it in?
     
     - Authoritarian old admins not very happy in giving charge of groups to new/young bloods/personal EGO taking over community?
     - OS became more user friendly
     - Internet revolution
     - Software based communities <fedora user group, Ubuntu Loco, Drupal user group>
     - Money values more than Contribution for new generation <everyone applies through GSOC > :)
     
2. Whats future Ahead?
    
     - Is the whole idea of Linux User Group will be taken over by sub-fragmented communities?
     - What is needed to grow and keep our LUG intact.


Questions for self evaluation by audience. *

a) Do we really need Linux User Group now?
b) If yes how can i be part of it in improving the community participation of Linux user group.
c) What your heart desires? Fame/Glory or Money just via few months association with FOSS projects under  GSOC
